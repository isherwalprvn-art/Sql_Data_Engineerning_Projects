/*
Question: What are the most optimal skills for data engineers—balancing both demand and salary?
- Create a ranking column that combines demand count and median salary to identify the most valuable skills.
- Focus only on remote Data Engineer positions with specified annual salaries.
- Why?
    - This approach highlights skills that balance market demand and financial reward. It weights core skills appropriately instead of letting rare, outlier skills distort the results.
    - The natural log transformation ensures that both high-salary and widely in-demand skills surface as the most practical and valuable to learn for data engineering careers.
